    <h1>Intro:</h1><br>
    <P>Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies. Whether by cause or accident, he was the quickest to seize the moment and make it his own. Captain Jack's first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.

The son of Captain Edward Teague, Jack was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon. Before he became known as "Captain Jack Sparrow" he was simply known as Jack Sparrow, a teenage stowaway who, even then, had a desire for adventure. Young Jack first sailed on the Barnacle with a ragtag crew on a quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Cortés. A few years after his teenage adventures, an encounter with the infamous rogue pirates forced Jack to abandon the pirate life and take employment in the East India Trading Company. After five years of faithful service, during which he sailed across all the Seven Seas, he was given command of the Wicked Wench, a ship owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. As Beckett's employee, Sparrow searched for the mystical island of Kerma and its treasure,

   Escape from the rogues
"If we had left you behind, you would have been the one that Captain Teague hanged at dawn."
"And I saved yours. I figure we’re square, mate."
"That is better, mon ami! There is no sense in old friends quarreling over trifles, is there?"
―Christophe-Julien de Rapièr and Jack Sparrow[src]
Press-ganged into a service on La Vipère, Jack involuntarily served under Christophe for a few weeks. Christophe even started to make plans for making his own fleet, and he asked Jack to join him as captain of one of his vessels. Jack participated in the Attack on the Dutch flute, and after the battle, he met Pharaoh Taharka, the ruler of the mythical island of Kerma. Mortally wounded, the old Pharaoh gave Jack the magical talisman. Christophe took the talisman from Jack, and decided to find Kerma. Not wanting Jack with him anymore, Christophe left him in a longboat on the open sea. Robert Greene, a young pirate onboard La Vipère, jumped into the sea and joined Jack in the boat. After they reached land, they joined the East India Trading Company. For the next five years, Jack faithfully served the Company, sailing across all the Seven Seas, eventually reaching the rank of First Mate.[14]

      First Mate
"Young, naïve, inexperienced in the ways of the world...lads like yourself tend to have rampageous imaginations. They want adventure, danger, they imagine themselves swashbucklers. So they envision peril in every new sail."
―Nathaniel Bainbridge to Jack Sparrow[src]
When he was 25 years old, Jack sailed aboard the EITC brig Fair Wind as the First Mate under Captain Nathaniel Bainbridge. When Bainbridge was killed in a battle with pirates led by Jack's old love interest Esmeralda, now a Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, Jack took command of the Fair Wind and managed to save the ship and most of its cargo from falling into the hands of Esmeralda's pirates. Cutler Beckett, an EITC Director for West Africa, was so impressed, that he offered him to take command of Marlin, a slave ship of the Company, as her captain. But Sparrow refused to transport slaves, so Beckett gave him command of the Wicked Wench, a merchant vessel of the Company.[14]

Captain Sparrow
"I have another ship. It’s one I actually own. It’s an older ship. The shipwrights have told me that converting her hold to haul slaves would be expensive, and rather time-consuming, so I bought her for hauling other cargos. She’s called the Wicked Wench. Would you like to sail her for me, Captain Sparrow?"
"Yes, I would, sir. I’d be pleased to do that."
―Cutler Beckett and Jack Sparrow, after Jack refused to captain Marlin, a slave ship[src]
Jack Sparrow and the Wicked Wench were an unbeatable team, and Jack sailed on many voyages for the Company. One day, Beckett proposed to Jack that he'd organize a search for the lost island of Kerma, as well as the Shining City of Zerzura with its treasure-filled labyrinth. Jack embarked on a voyage, while assisted by Beckett's house slave, Ayisha, who was actually princess Amenirdis, a member of the Kerman royal family.[14]

Jack and Ayisha sailed for the Bahamas, where they liberated Ayisha's brother, prince Shabako because Ayisha refused to give Jack the location of the island until her brother was safe. After they sailed back for Africa, the Wench was attacked by Boris Palachnik's rogue pirates. Ayisha's magic destroyed the pirate ship, but the Wicked Wench was badly damaged. Jack and his crew were saved by Esmeralda, whose crew helped Jack to repair his ship. A few days later, with the help of his compass, Jack found Christophe-Julien de Rapièr, whose help he needed to open the gates of the Zerzuran labyrinth.[14]

The Wench and La Vipère sailed for Kerma, where Jack, Amenirdis, and Christophe entered the labyrinth. They found the treasure, and Jack tricked Christophe into taking a rock instead of the Heart of Zerzura. Beliving that he has the famous jewel, Christophe sailed off. Jack, who had developed an attraction towards Amenirdis, decided not to reveal the location of Kerma to Beckett, due to knowing that Beckett would enslave the inhabitants of the legendary island.[14]

A few days later, the Wench returned to Calabar. Beckett, angry that Sparrow had betrayed him, ordered Sparrow to carry a cargo of slaves to New Avalon in the Caribbean for Viscount Penwallow, Beckett's immediate supervisor and patron. Jack Sparrow set off with the Wicked Wench's hold filled with slaves following his pick up, but he couldn't stand the idea of humans beings as "cargo," so he resolved to free them. Jack sailed back to illusion-hidden Kerma, and the island's ruler, Pharaoh Shabako, agreed to give the slaves asylum there. Furious at being disobeyed, Cutler Beckett sent five EITC ships after Jack, and when he finally caught him, had Jack thrown into prison.[14]

An outlaw
"You're going to destroy your own property? Just to get back at me?"
"She’s not just a ship to you, Jack. And yes. That's precisely what I am going to do."
"You’re like a child. An overgrown, angry child. Just because you can’t have what you want, you do this. It’s...twisted. Mad."
"And what is it that I want, Jack?"
"Fear. Love. Respect. None of which you will get from me."
―Jack Sparrow and Cutler Beckett[src]
After languishing for a couple of months, Beckett ordered Jack to be brought within sight of the Wicked Wench about a mile off the coast of Western Africa. Beckett and his operative, Ian Mercer, branded Jack with a "P" brand on his right forearm, marking him forever as a pirate. Then Beckett ordered his ship to fire on the anchored Wicked Wench, using inflammable "carcass charges." Seeing his beloved Wench in flames, Jack Sparrow broke free from his captors, dived into the ocean and swam for his ship, hoping to rescue her. But it was lost, as Jack was trapped in his own cabin and went down with his sunken ship. Neither dead nor alive, Jack found himself in a strange place. Knowing that he was on the path to the Land of the Dead, Jack spoke a magical incantation, which allowed him to summon Davy Jones, the Lord of the sea.[14]

Jack then struck a bargain with Jones. In exchange for the restoration of the Wicked Wench, Jack promised to give up his position as captain of the ship in thirteen years time so as to serve for a century aboard Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman. Jones agreed and raised the Wench from the depths. Jack, however, had no intention of keeping his end of the bargain, having become too attached to his beloved ship and not wanting to serve anyone. Inspired by the Biblical parable of "the pearl of great price", he rechristened the Wicked Wench as the Black Pearl, and set out for a life of adventure as a pirate.[14]
